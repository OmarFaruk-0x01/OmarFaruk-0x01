## Cover Letter
With four years of non-professional experience and one year of professional experience as a Frontend Developer. My skills shine in designing smooth website functionality, elegant appearances, and efficient operation.

I'm a dedicated learner, constantly exploring new technologies. I have honed my skills and expertise in backend architecture, design patterns, data structures and algorithms. I've completed numerous personal projects. My next goal is to contribute to the open-source GoLang community.

In my professional journey, I've thrived in three distinct projects. I architected and developed a JobPortal akin to BDJobs. For Japaha Company LTD, I designed ShikakusSchool, a lightweight Learning Management System (LMS) site, and streamlined operations using Docker, Jenkins, and AWS EC2. 

I'm enthusiastic about embracing new challenges and making meaningful contributions.
