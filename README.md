## Cover Letter
*I have four* years of non-professional experience and one year of professional experience as a Frontend Developer. I’m strictly focusing on the backend architecture, design patterns, and DSA. I have spent a lot of time learning advanced technologies and created a lot of personal projects with 1,401 commits in the last year. My Next target is to contribute to the open-source GoLang community.
I worked on three different projects in my professional career. I designed and developed a JobPortal like BDJobs. ShikakusSchool is a Lightweight LMS site for a Japanese Company called Japaha Company LTD. I also implemented their CI/CD integration with Docker, Jenkins, and AWS EC2.


## Open Source Project
**Mongo-Backup:** This is a GoLang script for backing up MongoDB databases and pushing the backup files to AWS S3. It provides a command-line interface for specifying the MongoDB URI, database name, AWS S3 bucket details, and other options.

**Umed Blog:** The blog website is made by Remix Js for the front-end, Express Js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. Additionally, the website includes advanced features such as admin authentication, a custom build editor for admin, user profile, and search.
